The provided datasets contain the studentâ€™s record like gender, stream of education, percentage marks at different levels of education, board etc
The data is divided into train and test data. 

The train dataset has the information of former students from the institute along with a status flag to indicate if the student was placed or not. 

The test dataset contains the information of the current students in the institute. 

The goal is to utilize the labelled train data and build a robust classification model to predict if the students in the test dataset are likely to be placed or not.
